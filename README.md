# Movie Search App using Open Movie Database

A web application built using vanilla Javascript, to search movie titles in the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

## Demo

## Setup

The app can be run locally using a web server like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). To do so, clone the repo and run `http-server` in the root directory.

## Features

- Basic responsive layout
- Search movies based on title
- Specific message shown when no search term was entered or no search results found

## Roadmap

The following features are currently not implemented, but are ideas I might get around to:
- Loading indicator during search
- Lazy loading of images
- Pagination
- Show synopsys
- Search on pressing Enter
